# Pi-Calculation-Compillation
PCC (![Vai Corinthians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5B3LU5AZTg)) is just a compilattion of scripts among programming languages on calculating aproximations of pi. I don't expect to update this repo very often.

## [ Formula Explanation and Pseudo Code ]
### Leibniz formula for Ï€

   Time Complexity:
        **O(N * logN * loglogN), where**
        N = number of iterations
        Division of two numbers of order O(N) takes O(logN loglogN) time.
